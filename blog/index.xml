      <description>--
Čech complexes are one of the main tools for building a simplicial complex from data and are used regularly for Persistent Homology. This post provides an interactive demonstration of the Čech complex for a 2-dimensional data set. It is meant to help newcomers gain an intuition about the complex.
Visualization The resulting simplicial complex is overlaid on top of the covers. Here we only calculate the nerve up to order 2, i.</description>

      <title>Nerves and Towers I: Introduction</title>

      <description>In unsupervised learning, one of the main questions we want to answer is what type of structure does this set or shape have? The field of algebraic topology supplies a few tools to help answer this question. We can ask topological questions about the data, such as how many clusters or connected components are there? or are there gaps, holes, or voids in the data?. These question can be easy to answer if the shape is well defined, but in practice, we instead have data sampled from that shape.</description>

      <description>The nerve is a simplicial complex built from a cover. It is a discrete summarization of the cover that captures the interesting topological features. Additionally, if the cover is sufficiently refined, then the nerve is guaranteed to preserve the topological features. A nerve of a cover is constructed in a very straight forward way: An (n-1)-dimensional simplex is added for each nonempty n-way intersection of elements of the cover.
The nerve of a cover \(~\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{U})\) is a set of simplices such that $$ \mathcal{N} (\mathcal{U}) = \left\{(j, \ldots, k) : \bigcap_{i = j, \ldots, k} U_i \right\}$$  The one-way intersection of a set is vacuously nonempty, so we add a vertex for every element of the cover.</description>

      <description>Once we understand the tower, we will show that it plays nice with all of the other definitions we have constructed so far and how it allows us to naturally define a multiscale mapper.
A tower \(~\mathcal{T} \) is a tuple ( \(T_\epsilon\), \(\{t_{\epsilon, \epsilon^\prime}\}\)) of indexed objects \( T_\epsilon \) with morphisms \[t_{\epsilon, \epsilon^\prime}: T_\epsilon \to T_{\epsilon^\prime} \] defined when \( \epsilon \le \epsilon^\prime \). Additionally, we must have that morphisms are composable, that is \( t_{\epsilon, \epsilon^\prime} \circ t_{\epsilon^\prime, \epsilon^{\prime \prime}} = t_{\epsilon, \epsilon^{\prime \prime}} \).</description>

      <title>What is Mapper?</title>

      <description>As one of the main tools from the field of Topological Data Analysis, Mapper has been shown to be particularly useful for exploring high dimensional point cloud data. This post will walk through the mapper construction from an intuitive perspective and demonstrate how it can be constructed on a toy example.
Motivation Mapper is way to construct a graph (or simplicial complex) from data in a way that reveals the some of the topological features of the space.</description>

      <description>In this post, We propose a new software development methodology dubbed debug-driven development. Building upon work out of context and ignoring basic principles of time management, our proposed method cuts the average development* time of a project in half.
By using test driven development, we can redefine the develop-debug process to completely eliminate the development step. Instead of developing a feature, we can fix a broken test and in doing so the development portion of the develop-debug process disappears.</description>

      <title>The Law of Demeter</title>

      <description>The Law of Demeter is a small set of rules for how objects should interact with each other. It helps define the boundaries between objects and determine who controls and owns what. Applying this design principle gives each object their own personal space and keeps objects from micromanaging others.
The rules The LoD provides actionable and quantifiable rules for structuring software that help enable the SOLID principles. It defines what methods and variables an object is allowed to call.</description>
