      <description>While visiting Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, I collaborated with Dustin L. Arendt to develop new ways Mapper could be applied for explaining machine learning models.
Initial progress in this direction will be a part of the IEEE VIS 2018 Workshop on VISxAI.</description>

      <description>In collaboration with Bei Wang and Bala Krishnamoorthy, I am developing ways of composing Mappers built from different filter functions together, and developing techniques for quantifying the topological correlation and complexity inherent in particular filter functions.
I presented preliminary results of this work at the Young Researchers Forum at SoCG 2018. See the abstract here.</description>

      <description>I was awarded a NASA space grant through WSU to develop methods using Topological Data Analysis for classifying galaxies that have WR-bumps or not.
Check out my blog post Classification using Persistence Images for a walk through on the methods I used.</description>
