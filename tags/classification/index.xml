      <description>Galaxies Disclaimer: This sort of feature engineering turned out to be a bit overkill for this project, but it does provide a nice, easy to understand, demonstration of how to use the methods.
Background In an effort to make sense of the torrent of data coming from the James Webb Telescope, we need fast and reliable ways to classifying and sifting through the data.
