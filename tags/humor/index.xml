      <description>I heard once that debugging and fixing defects amounts to half the cost of software development 1. Half of the time you spend writing code, you&amp;rsquo;re not actually writing code, your fixing code. It seems to me that a strong majority of the software development tools we have are devoted to this effort. Yeah, text editors are for writing code, but all the little tools like debuggers, print statements, and inspect element, are designed for fixing code.</description>
